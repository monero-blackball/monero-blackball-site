Download the files, extract them, and place them in the `.shared-ring-db` folder. This folder should then have two files: `data.mdb` and `lock.mdb`.

This folder should be hidden by default, so make sure to configure your file explorer to view hidden folders or simply go there directly.

For Windows, this located in `C:\ProgramData\.shared-ringdb`

For Mac OS X and Linux, this is located in `~/.shared-ringdb`

Note that ~ is typically short for `home/<user-name>`
